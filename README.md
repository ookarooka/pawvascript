## Introduction
Ever wish that JavaScript had less symbols and more dogs? We did, so we made PawvaScript!

PawvaScript is an object-oriented scripting language designed to make JavaScript more programmer-friendly. PawvaScript draws on many fundamentals from JavaScript but replaces confusing symbols with clear terms, adds types to help with debugging, and adds some dog related stuff just for fun.

## Features
* Language for scripting
* Static typing
* Loops and conditionals
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* 5 types (String, Boolean, Number, Function, Object)
* Single and multi-line comments
* No semicolons after each line
* Object-Oriented 


## Example Programs

### The Basics

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                               JAVASCRIPT

// initialize variables by barking

bark string dogName is "Cece"                             let dogName = "Cece";

bark number dogAge is 12                                  let dogAge = 12;

bark boolean isCute is true                               let isCute = true;

bark boolean dogNames[string] is ["Cece", "Fluffy"]       let dogNames = ["Cece", "Fluffy"]
